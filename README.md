# AdventOfCode2021
Here are my anwsers for the 25 day coding challenge provided by (adventofcode.com)[adventofcode.com]. I've taken this challenge as an oppertunity to learn C.

## Logs

### Day 1
The total time it took me to solve the problem was less than 5 minutes. It took me however an hour to get the code to read my .txt file correctly.
I was helped by a classmate of mine for some problems relating to pointers. This is something I will have to dive in for myself as well.
I've learnt some things about libraries.

### Day 2
O boy... This day took way longer than I can permit myself in the future. Again the logic was very very easy. But because the file was structured with a word and then an integer I struggled  getting it read correctly. In the end I used a 2dim array with one dimension for the string and the other for the integer. Mainly because of me being stupid I've learnt a lot about pointers, types and how this all differs from what I know. 
I've learnt that char[] is the substitute for strings and how it differs to char*, which is a pointer to memory. 
Tl;Dr: Spent way to much time but I won't make the same errors again (no promises.).
